comment: |
  The implementation is rather straight-forward. It uses `std::panic::set_hook()`
  to install a panic hook which uses `console.error()` from JavaScript to log a
  panic and the backtrace retrieved by creating a `new Error()`.
  
  The code is also thoroughly documented using both rustdocs and comments and
  explains possible edge cases due to browser differences.
